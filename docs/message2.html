  I'm pretty sure I just watched Futurama and sulked for a week when I moved home. I'm guessing you'll be slightly more emptionally mature about it, but I know it's probably not your preferred option right now.<br>
  So here's something I thought you might enjoy. (Or maybe you don't want to think about Vietnam and all the cool stuff you've done right now? Either way I felt like I'd committed to the present at this point. It won a Pulitzer so if nothing else, you can definitely feel smug reading it).
<br>
  Take your time, be kind to yourself, and you'll get through this. More likely even, you'll thrive.


<br>
  <br>Take care Emma x
