  If you're gonna be drinking your meds, you might as well enjoy them. I couldn't find any coffee beans that Amazon would send to Australia, (*I suspect this is probably unconscious bias on Amazon's part), so you'll have to make do with your own, notoriously poor coffee culture. <br>I hope this brings you some enjoyment/ helps you save a bit of money for something fun. And if all else fails, I hear it's very good for grinding your own spices. <br>I've included a photo of my pals, who were helping me as I wrote this. <br>Take care Emma x
