Increasing age, female sex, cardiac disease, and some metabolic disturbances (notably hypokalaemia) predispose to QT prolongation."],"title":"Ondansetron","importstitle":["St John's Wort","Almotriptan","Amifampridine","Aminophylline","Amiodarone","Amisulpride","Amphotericin","Apomorphine","Arsenic trioxide","Artemether","Artenimol","Bambuterol","Beclometasone","Bedaquiline","Bendroflumethiazide","Betamethasone","Bosutinib","Budesonide","Bumetanide","Bupropion","Buspirone","Cabozantinib","Carbamazepine","Ceritinib","Chlorothiazide","Chlorpromazine","Chlortalidone","Citalopram","Clarithromycin","Clomipramine","Clopamide","Crizotinib","Cyclopenthiazide","Dapoxetine","Dasatinib","Deflazacort","Delamanid","Dexamethasone","Dexamfetamine","Disopyramide","Domperidone","Dronedarone","Droperidol","Duloxetine","Eletriptan","Enzalutamide","Eribulin","Erythromycin","Escitalopram","Fentanyl","Fingolimod","Flecainide","Fludrocortisone","Fluoxetine","Fluphenazine","Fluvoxamine","Formoterol","Fosphenytoin","Frovatriptan","Furosemide","Granisetron","Haloperidol","Hydrochlorothiazide","Hydrocortisone","Hydroflumethiazide","Hydroxyzine","Imipramine","Indacaterol","Indapamide","Inotuzumab ozogamicin","Isocarboxazid","Ivabradine","Lapatinib","Levomepromazine","Linezolid","Lisdexamfetamine","Lithium","Lofexidine","Mefloquine","Methadone","Methylprednisolone","Methylthioninium chloride","Metolazone","Mianserin","Mirtazapine","Mizolastine","Moclobemide","Moxifloxacin","Naratriptan","Nilotinib","Olodaterol","Osimertinib","Paliperidone","Palonosetron","Panobinostat","Paroxetine","Pasireotide","Pazopanib","Pentamidine","Pentazocine","Pethidine","Phenelzine","Phenobarbital","Phenytoin","Pimozide","Prednisolone","Prednisone","Primidone","Procarbazine","Quinine","Ranolazine","Rasagiline","Ribociclib","Rifampicin","Risperidone","Rizatriptan","Safinamide","Salbutamol","Salmeterol","Saquinavir","Selegiline","Sertraline","Sildenafil","Sorafenib","Sotalol","Sulpiride","Sumatriptan","Sunitinib","Tapentadol","Tedizolid","Telavancin","Terbutaline","Tetrabenazine","Theophylline","Tizanidine","Tolterodine","Torasemide","Toremifene","Tramadol","Tranylcypromine","Trazodone","Triamcinolone","Tryptophan","Vandetanib","Vardenafil","Vemurafenib","Venlafaxine","Vilanterol","Vinflunine","Voriconazole","Vortioxetine","Xipamide","Zolmitriptan","Zuclopenthixol"],"mildtot":0,"modtot":2,"sevtot":13,"nstot":6,"studytot":2,"anectot":0,"theorettot":6,"nsetot":13},{"name":"BNF.Oxycodone.Oxycodone","imports":["BNF.Carbamazepine.Carbamazepine","BNF.Chlordiazepoxide.Chlordiazepoxide","BNF.Clarithromycin.Clarithromycin","BNF.Clonazepam.Clonazepam","BNF.Codeine.Codeine","BNF.Cyclizine.Cyclizine","BNF.Diazepam.Diazepam","BNF.Dihydrocodeine.Dihydrocodeine","BNF.Diltiazem.Diltiazem","BNF.Fentanyl.Fentanyl","BNF.Gabapentin.Gabapentin","BNF.Haloperidol.Haloperidol","BNF.Ketamine.Ketamine","BNF.Levetiracetam.Levetiracetam","BNF.Levomepromazine.Levomepromazine","BNF.Lorazepam.Lorazepam","BNF.Midazolam.Midazolam","BNF.Mirtazapine.Mirtazapine","BNF.Morphine.Morphine","BNF.Phenytoin.Phenytoin","BNF.Prochlorperazine.Prochlorperazine","BNF.Temazepam.Temazepam","BNF.Tramadol.Tramadol","BNF.Trazodone.Trazodone","BNF.Venlafaxine.Venlafaxine","BNF.Zopiclone.Zopiclone"],"Severity":["Moderate","NotSet","Severe","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","Moderate","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","Moderate","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet"],"Evidence":["Study","NotSet","Study","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","Study","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","Study","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet","NotSet"],"Interactions Info":["Carbamazepine is predicted to decrease the exposure to oxycodone.
