# D3
This is a repository for my attempts to learn to use [D3.js.](https://d3js.org/)

Currently, it revolves largely around visualising [BNF drug-listed interactions.](https://fergustaylor.github.io/categories/bnf/)

Update 17/11/18: I've moved /bnf-interactions to a [dedicated github repository.](https://github.com/fergustaylor/bnf-interactions/)

This project started as a very vague, learning experiment for d3.js.
I'm continuing to learn to use d3.js here, but moving the BNF interactions data into its own repository so it's easier for anyone to learn to collect and work with the BNF data - seperate from these other unrelated projects, or similar variants which are confusingly connected.
